"""
Prevent multiple processes from doing the same operation on a host, using good
old Linux fnctl locking.

fcntl's ``flock`` is a great choice to prevent deadlocks if/when your process
crashes because the system will release any locks of a process when it dies.
``man fcntl`` for details.

Anyway, we provide a Lock class that acts as a context manager for both
blocking and non-blocking fcntl locks.

It's especially useful to orchestrate Ansible Action plugins.

Blocking locks
--------------

Consider this little program:

.. code-block:: python

    import cli2
    import os
    os.environ['LOG_LEVEL'] = 'DEBUG'
    with cli2.Lock('/tmp/mylock') as lock:
        input('say hello')

- Run it in a first terminal: it will log "Acquired" and show the "say hello"
  input.
- Run it in another terminal: it will log "Waiting"
- Type enter in the first terminal: it will release the lock and exit
- Then the second terminal will log "Acquired" and display the say hello input

You got this: two programs cannot enter the same blocking lock at the same
time.

Non blocking locks
------------------

You're starting a bunch of processes that potentially want to do the same thing
at the same time, ie. download a file to cache locally prior to sending it.

Only one process must do the caching download, the first one that gets the
lock, all others will sit there and wait.

This is possible with a non-blocking lock that we later convert into a blocking
lock.

.. code-block:: python

    with cli2.Lock('/tmp/mylock', blocking=False) as lock:
        if lock.acquired:
            # we got the lock, proceed to downloading safely
            do_download()
        else:
            # couldn't acquired the lock because another process got it
            # let's just wait for that other process to finish by converting
            # the non-blocking lock into a blocking one
            lock.block()

    # all processes can safely process to uploading
    do_upload()

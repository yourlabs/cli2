code2: AI coding
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

code2 is pre-alpha, join development!

code2 sits on top of prompt2 and:

- scans the project
- offers prompt2 jinja plugins based on the project scan
- has a workflow plugin system, which might as well one day join prompt2, when
  we can switch from coding them in python into coding them in txt ...

Roadmap
=======

1. code2 analyze: let the AI investigate your project
2. code2 cmd: run a command until it passes, AI+TDD
3. code2 hack: work on any kind of problem
4. code2 inspect: inspect a project and store metadata about it
5. code2 readme: generate a readme for any source dump
6. AI functions plugins: search the web, stackoverflow, ask on IRC, mailing
   lists...

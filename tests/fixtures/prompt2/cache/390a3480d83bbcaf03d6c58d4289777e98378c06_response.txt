To find the number of positive integers less than 10,000 that have digits summing to 8, we can use the stars and bars method from combinatorics. 

We need to consider numbers with 1, 2, 3, or 4 digits. Each number can be represented as a four-digit number with leading zeros (from 0000 to 9999), but we exclude the number 0000 since we are only interested in positive integers. The problem reduces to finding the number of non-negative integer solutions to the equation \(d_1 + d_2 + d_3 + d_4 = 8\), where each \(d_i\) is a digit (0-9). Since the sum is 8, each digit will automatically be between 0 and 8, so we don't need to worry about the upper limit of 9.

Using the stars and bars theorem, the number of solutions is given by:
\[
\binom{8 + 4 - 1}{4 - 1} = \binom{11}{3}
\]

Calculating this, we get:
\[
\binom{11}{3} = \frac{11 \times 10 \times 9}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 165
\]

To verify, we can break it down by the number of digits:
- **1-digit numbers**: Only 8 (1 number).
- **2-digit numbers**: Solutions to \(a + b = 8\) with \(a \geq 1\). This is \(\binom{8}{1} = 8\) numbers.
- **3-digit numbers**: Solutions to \(a + b + c = 8\) with \(a \geq 1\). This is \(\binom{9}{2} = 36\) numbers.
- **4-digit numbers**: Solutions to \(a + b + c + d = 8\) with \(a \geq 1\). This is \(\binom{10}{3} = 120\) numbers.

Adding these together: \(1 + 8 + 36 + 120 = 165\).

Thus, the number of positive integers less than 10,000 with digits summing to 8 is \(\boxed{165}\).

To write a "Hello, World!" program in Python, you can use the **`print()`** function:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

This program will output:
```
Hello, World!
```

**Notes**:
- In Python 3, `print` is a function and requires parentheses.
- The string can also use single quotes: `print('Hello, World!')`.

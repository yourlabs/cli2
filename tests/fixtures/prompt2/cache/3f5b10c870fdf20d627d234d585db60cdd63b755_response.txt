To write a "Hello, World!" program in Python, you can use the following simple script:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

**Steps**:
1. Use the `print()` function.
2. Pass the string `"Hello, World!"` as the argument inside the parentheses.
3. Run the script (e.g., save it as `hello.py` and execute via `python hello.py` in the terminal).

This will output:  
`Hello, World!`

Here's a simple "Hello, World!" program in Python:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

To run this:
1. Save it in a file with a `.py` extension (e.g., `hello.py`)
2. Execute it using Python with the command: `python hello.py` (or `python3 hello.py` depending on your system)

This will output:
```
Hello, World!
```

It seems you're asking about a **"context bar"**, but the context isn't clear. Could you provide more details? Here's how I can help depending on the scenario:

1. **Software/App Context Bar** (e.g., design tools, IDEs, browsers):  
   - A toolbar that changes dynamically based on the active task (e.g., Photoshop's context-sensitive options when selecting a tool).  
   - Example: Right-click menus, browser address bars with search suggestions, etc.

2. **Programming/UI Framework Context Bar**:  
   - If you're building a UI, frameworks like React, Flutter, or Android might have components for dynamic context-aware toolbars.  

3. **Troubleshooting**:  
   - If you're encountering an issue with a context bar (e.g., it‚Äôs missing or malfunctioning), share details about the platform/app.  

Let me know more specifics, and I‚Äôll tailor the answer! üõ†Ô∏è

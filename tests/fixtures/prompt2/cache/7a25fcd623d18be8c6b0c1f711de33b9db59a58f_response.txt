It seems like you're asking about a "context bar," but could you clarify a bit more? Are you referring to:

1. **A UI/design element** (e.g., a toolbar or menu that changes based on user context)?  
2. **A software feature** in a specific app (e.g., browser, editor, or IDE)?  
3. **A programming concept** (e.g., handling context in code)?  

Let me know your specific use case or goal, and Iâ€™ll help! ðŸ¤–âœ¨

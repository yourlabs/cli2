Here's a simple "Hello, World!" program in Python:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

To run this:
1. Save it in a file (e.g., `hello.py`)
2. Execute it with Python: `python hello.py`

For a slightly more structured version (common in larger programs):

```python
def main():
    print("Hello, World!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Both versions will output:
```
Hello, World!
```

The first example is the most minimal version, while the second demonstrates a common Python pattern where code execution starts from the `main()` function when the script is run directly.
